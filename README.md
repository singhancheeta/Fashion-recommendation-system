# 👗 Fashion Recommendation System

An AI-powered visual recommendation engine that suggests similar fashion items from a dataset of over 47,000 images using **deep learning** and **KNN-based similarity**.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

This system allows users to **upload an image of a clothing item** (like a dress, jacket, or shoe) and returns the **top 5 most visually similar items** using:

- 🎯 Deep CNN (ResNet18) for feature extraction  
- 🤝 Cosine similarity for finding visually close items  
- 🌐 Streamlit interface for easy web interaction

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ **ResNet18-based visual embeddings** using PyTorch  
- ✅ **K-Nearest Neighbors** (KNN) matching for top-5 results  
- ✅ **Streamlit-based web UI** for image upload and display  
- ✅ Works directly on folder-based datasets (e.g., `fashion_dataset/`)  
- ✅ Auto-computes embeddings on startup

## 🗂 Dataset Structure

You can use the [Fashion Product Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small) or any custom dataset with images.

---

## 📦 To-Do / Enhancements

- Add labels/tags filtering (e.g., only shoes or jackets)
- Store precomputed features in `.npy` or MongoDB
- Add logging and better error handling
