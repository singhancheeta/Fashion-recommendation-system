# Fashion-recommendation-system

**Overview**
The Fashion Recommendation System is an AI-driven application designed to provide personalized fashion recommendations to users. By leveraging advanced deep learning and machine learning techniques, the system processes a diverse array of fashion items, spanning categories such as clothing, footwear, and accessories, to deliver tailored suggestions that enhance the online shopping experience.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in the Fashion Recommendation System is a diverse and comprehensive collection of 47000 fashion images, publicly available on Kaggle. It encompasses a wide range of fashion items, including but not limited to clothing, footwear, and accessories. This variety ensures that the recommendation system can cater to a broad spectrum of user preferences and style inclinations.

**Features**
Image Feature Extraction: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract detailed features from fashion images.
Similarity Calculation: Employs the K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm to calculate item similarities based on extracted features.
Personalized Recommendations: Generates real-time, user-specific fashion suggestions.
Scalability: Designed to handle large datasets and integrate seamlessly with various e-commerce platforms.

**Technologies used**
Programming Language: Python
Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow
Machine Learning Library: scikit-learn
Database: MongoDB

**Project Components**
1. Data Preprocessing
The initial phase involves data preprocessing, where a dataset of 4000 diverse fashion images is cleaned and prepared for analysis. This step includes resizing images, normalization, and data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and cropping to enhance the training dataset. The goal is to ensure that the images are in a consistent format, which is crucial for the accuracy of the CNN model.

2. Model Training
In this phase, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are employed to extract detailed features from the fashion images. The CNN architecture captures various aspects of the images, from low-level features like edges and textures to high-level features like shapes and patterns. This hierarchical feature learning is essential for understanding and differentiating the fashion items.

3. Similarity Calculation
Once the features are extracted, the K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm is used to calculate the similarity between items. KNN identifies the k most similar items to a given fashion item based on the feature vectors obtained from the CNN. This non-parametric algorithm is chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling similarity-based tasks.

4. Recommendation Generation
The final component involves generating personalized recommendations. By combining the extracted features and similarity scores, the system provides users with a list of fashion items that closely match their preferences. This step is designed to enhance the user experience by delivering accurate and relevant fashion suggestions.

5. Integration and Deployment
The system is implemented using Python and key libraries such as TensorFlow for deep learning and scikit-learn for machine learning. MongoDB is used as the database for its flexibility in handling unstructured data. The project also includes a web application developed using Flask/Django, providing a user-friendly interface for browsing and receiving recommendations.
